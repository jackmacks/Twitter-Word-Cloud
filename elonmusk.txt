That would be great. @SawyerMerritt Charlie Ergen is trying steal the 12GHz band meant for space Internet. Not cool. @cleantechnica Progress @teslaownersSV @Tesla We‚Äôre making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month. @teslaownersSV @cb_doge It‚Äôs a flat trade @EvaFoxU @cb_doge ü§£ @teslaownersSV Autonomous rocket landing on autonomous ship @cb_doge Actually true. Then I suggested to the team that it didn‚Äôt need to be quite so pointy, since that‚Äôs just based on a movie joke, but everyone likes it pointy, so we kept it that way. @BillyM2k @CryptoWhale üòã bagels @hohocho If inflation calms down, we can lower prices for cars Tesla is to protect life on Earth,
SpaceX to extend life beyond. @PPathole 20 to 30 years from first human landing if launch rate growth is exponential.

Assumes transferring ~100k each rendezvous and ~1M total people needed. Mars may be a fixer upper of a planet, but it has great potential! @tim_ottawa @teslaownersSV Mars is, admittedly, a fixer upper of a planet @teslaownersSV The scale is ü§Ø &amp; anyone can visit! https://t.co/ozWk7GxcEu @waitbutwhy I wonder if there is a species in the Magellanic Clouds wondering who lives in the big galaxy they orbit @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Some small tubes &amp; wiring need to be nested in a bigger tube for thermal protection, kinda like conduit in a house. 

Engines themselves &amp; booster base are extremely robust. High strength stainless steel is bulletproof to a handgun at ~2.5mm thickness. Booster dome is 4mm. @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Electric power for booster &amp; ship is needed even when engines aren‚Äôt running &amp; incremental power draw of TVC isn‚Äôt too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons, all things considered.

Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud, forming a MOX bomb.

Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.

Raptors in production now have electric TVC, saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster. Dragon launching in 2 mins https://t.co/DBQDCbBy6B @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Most importantly, we need to delete or thermally protect remaining secondary structure, so we can remove shrouds @arctechinc 10.13 goes to internal beta tomorrow, external next week. Should handle Chuck‚Äôs complex left turn.

Beta v11 hopefully end of next month, which just amounts to incorporating highway. Importance of ‚Äúv11‚Äù has been reduced by all the 10.x releases. We‚Äôre already mostly at v11. @shacknews üí© = bs @karpathy Thanks for everything you have done for Tesla! It has been an honor working with you. @BillFOXLA @FoxNews Wow @ajtourville @Twitter üßê @BillyM2k ü§£ü§£ @DavidSacks Absolutely.

Just think of any battery pack as super high grade ore ‚Äì it is always better to start with high grade ore than low grade! @cb_doge But Fifth Element was great @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @planet4589 @NASASpaceflight Base of the vehicle seems ok by flashlight. I was just out there about an hour ago. We shut down the pad for the night for safety. Will know more in the morning. @SpaceTelescope Cool, congrats! 

Now the simulators will have to spend more money on rendering. @ChrisDungeon @alexkehr @BillyM2k @levie Rereading The Life of Greece by Durant. In recent months, read American Caesar, Masters of Doom, Not Much of an Engineer, Wages of Destruction and Storm of Steel. 

Not much book fiction lately. Video games seem to have better stories these days. @dogeofficialceo ü§£ @alexkehr @BillyM2k @levie I do recommend a lot of books @levie And too many little red or green LED indicators @BillyM2k @levie YouTube keeps playing me the same annoying scam ads every time I use it. The algorithm is convinced that I can ‚Äúmake money through Audible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ @EvaFoxU ü§£ @PPathole @planet4589 @NASASpaceflight That is one of the things we will be doing going forward.

This particular issue, however, was specific to the engine spin start test (Raptor has a complex start sequence). 

Going forward, we won‚Äôt do a spin start test with all 33 engines at once. @PPathole @JoeTalkShow @BreitbartNews üíØ @adamirvinmusic @BreitbartNews Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America.

If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win ‚Äì he doesn‚Äôt even need to campaign. @JoeTalkShow @BreitbartNews Yeah, but too much drama. Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!?

Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69. @BreitbartNews I don‚Äôt hate the man, but it‚Äôs time for Trump to hang up his hat &amp; sail into the sunset.

Dems should also call off the attack ‚Äì don‚Äôt make it so that Trump‚Äôs only way to survive is to regain the Presidency. Tesla‚Äôs automatic cabin overheat protection should make a real difference with record heatwaves.

Ability to adjust activation temperature coming with next software release. @BonginoReport Not true @planet4589 @NASASpaceflight Cryogenic fuel is an added challenge, as it evaporates to create fuel-air explosion risk in a partially oxygen atmosphere like Earth.

That said, we have a lot of sensors to detect this. More later. @NASASpaceflight Yeah, actually not good.

Hopefully, other companies do same.

Also, Musk Foundation plans to donate directly to families.

Hopefully, details to be announced next month. @sm Agreed, this needs to be addressed @Liv_Boeree The world has gone mad @hiromichimizuno Terrible news @slashdot Great! @BillyM2k @slashdot That is indeed the real question @BillyM2k I had same great experience from Tokyo to Osaka @BillyM2k China &amp; Japan have awesome trains. 

Took bullet train from Beijing to Xi‚Äôan to see Terracotta Army of Áß¶ÂßãÁöá. Super fired up for future product development with our awesome Tesla team! Such an honor to work with them. @WholeMarsBlog Also, being ruggedized for relentless salt spray &amp; extreme winds &amp; storms in deep ocean is not easy @WholeMarsBlog No, it‚Äôs dual, high performance terminals, which are important for maintaining the connection in choppy seas &amp; heavy storms.

Still obv premium pricing, but way cheaper &amp; faster than alternatives.

SpaceX was paying $150k/month for a much worse connection to our ships! @JoshSeefried A flying, electric boat would be sickkk Starlink for boats! https://t.co/BQujU8Ngna @cb_doge Not bad! 

It is high time that the future looked like the future.

Same goes for fashion. @EvaFoxU @BillyM2k @tesla_adri Pretty much. A van would have more roof height, so you could stand or sit under it for shade. @BillyM2k Maybe with an optional solar power canopy that extends both sides of the van, tripling roof area @teslaownersSV üòâ @micsolana @rmcentush Exactly Maybe Tesla should make a highly configurable Robovan for people &amp; cargo? @PPathole Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated, even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse I hope you have big families and congrats to those who already do! Population of Mars is still zero people! Mark my words, they are sadly true Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.
